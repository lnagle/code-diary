## Overview

Working notes and formulas from my reading of Donald J. Wheeler's book, [Understanding Variation: The Key to Managing Chaos](https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Variation-Key-Managing-Chaos/dp/0945320531).

### What Is This Book About?

When measured, most processes will exhibit a certain amount of variation that can be considered normal. At the same time, processes can behave outside the normal bounds and we want to be able to identify these cases and take action on them. Distinguishing the normal from the abnormal process behavior is the tricky bit. Wheeler explains how we can do this using XmR charts (aka Shewhart Control Charts).

## Installing and Running

### Prerequisites 

- Python
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter 

### Running

1. Open `index.ipynb` and press `Run All`. Try changing the `sample_data` and switching back and forth between the two formulas, `xmr_data_from_median` and `xmr_data_from_average`

## Software Processes That Can Benefit From This Approach

- \# of bug produced over a given time
- Production outtage frequency and rates
- Managing time to get PRs reviewed and merged
